My Goal is to make poetry more attractive subject for the day ahead. I want to enhance the immersion
and confine the spirit oof the reader into a senses-melted world inf fusion or in fuse with music, image, sounds,
rythms, tempos, asmr, frequancies.

Interpoem offers poets a robust platform for crafting interactive, multimedia-rich poetry experiences.
With features like variables, conditional logic, and timed events, poets can create dynamic and
immersive poetic narratives. The supporting frameworks ensure that development and deployment
are efficient and accessible.

Interpoem is an advanced, non-existing language designed specifically for creating interactive
and immersive poetry experiences. This language allows poets to integrate multimedia elements,
user interactions, and dynamic content seamlessly within their poems.


I - |
To create a programming language specification and an initial interpreter for Interpoem, we'll start by
defining the language grammar and syntax. Then, we'll develop a basic parser and interpreter in
Python to convert Interpoem code into an HTML representation with interactive elements.

Step-by-Step Plan
1. Define the Grammar and Syntax: Create a formal specification for the Interpoem language.
2. Build the Parser: Develop a parser to read and understand Interpoem code.
3. Develop the Interpreter: Implement an interpreter to convert parsed Interpoem code into
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
4. Interactive Elements: Add support for multimedia and user interactions.
5. Testing: Create test cases to validate the functionality of the language.

1. Define the Grammar and Syntax
The grammar for Interpoem will be written using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation.

2. Build the Parser
We will use the Python `ply` library (Python Lex-Yacc) to build the parser.

3. Develop the Interpreter
The interpreter will convert the parsed Interpoem code into an interactive HTML representation.

4. Interactive Elements
We will add support for multimedia elements and user interactions.

5. Testing
Create test cases to validate the functionality of the parser and interpreter.

Conclusion

The provided code defines a basic structure for the Interpoem language, including its syntax, a parser
to convert Interpoem code into an AST, and an interpreter to generate an interactive HTML
representation. Further enhancements can include more advanced parsing, better error handling, and
a more sophisticated interpreter for handling complex interactions.
